PARKING LOT MONITORING

The main idea behind the project is to count the vacant parking space.

I am using a simple idea that if the vechicles is present in the particular parking area the output of the code is 1 else it will be 0.
Other idea is that if vechicle is parked in a particular parking lot rectangle box changes to red color and if no vechicles are present then the rectangle 
box is in green color.
I have writen code which specify that there are 12 parking space.And as the time passes the vechicles will come and park and it will count the noumber af vacant parking spaces available in the parking lot.
